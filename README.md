Introduction to LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT are advanced AI models designed to process and generate human-like text. They are trained on extensive datasets, learning language patterns and nuances, and are utilized in tasks such as language translation, information retrieval, and conversational agents.

The Bloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML
The Bloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML is a cutting-edge conversational AI model built on the LlamaIndex and Mistral 7B, tailored for chat-oriented tasks. It excels in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, enhancing user interaction with AI systems.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines information retrieval from external knowledge sources with LLMs to improve answer accuracy and reduce hallucination. The RAG system involves two main components: indexing and retrieval & generation.

Indexing
Data is loaded, split into smaller chunks, embedded using models like Sentence-BERT, and stored in a vector database such as FAISS. This process enhances efficient information retrieval.

Retrieval & Generation
User queries are embedded, matched with stored chunks in the vector database, and relevant contexts are retrieved. These contexts, along with the user query, are input to the LLM to generate informed responses.

Implementation with The Bloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML
We leverage the Bloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML model for RAG, facilitating meaningful and accurate responses to user queries by retrieving information from diverse sources like PDFs and links. The integration of LangChain into the RAG workflow ensures efficient query handling, information retrieval, and response generation.

System Setup
Environment Setup: Download necessary binaries and set up a Python environment with required libraries.
Model Loading: Use Hugging Face Transformers to load the Bloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML model.
Indexing: Use document loaders and text splitters to create vector databases with FAISS.
Retrieval & Generation: Retrieve relevant contexts from the vector database and generate responses using the LLM.
